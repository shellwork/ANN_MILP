# ANN_MILP
XJTLU MTH203 Operational Research Coursework 2
This repository is used to store the source codes of ANN for MILP problem especially focus on the P-Medium problem.

We train ANN model to predict the decision variable and minium optimization function. Our training data have two parts: one part is from MIP parameter generator as feature data and another part is the solution of MIP solver pyomo by inputing the parameter from the generator as the target data. Than we input the training matrix in ANN model and get the best fitted model.

Thanks to MTH203, we truly have learned a lot.
